            <h2>Conditionals</h2>
            <p>Types of Conditionals this section covers:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Conditionals 2</li>

              <li>Mixed conditionals 2 + 3</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="notice">Please notice the rule:<br>Rule: IF + WOULD = NO GOOD</p>

            <h3>Second conditional</h3>
            <p>The second conditional (2) is used to describe a unlikely or unreal situation in the present or in future.</p>

            <h3>Thid Conditional</h3>
            <p>The third conditional form (3) is used to describe a situation from the past.</p>

            <h3>Mixed conditionals</h3>
            <p>Mixed conditionals in the form of 2 + 3 are used to if we want to describe a unreal situation from the preset which could had an effect on the past.</p>
            <p>A mix of the conditional 3 + 2 is used when we want to describe a situation from the past which would had an impact on a situation in the present.</p>
