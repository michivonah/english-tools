### Second conditional
The second conditional (2) is used to describe a unlikely or unreal situation in the present or in future.

### Third Conditional
The third conditional form (3) is used to describe a situation from the past.

### Mixed conditionals
Mixed conditionals in the form of 2 + 3 are used to if we want to describe a unreal situation from the preset which could had an effect on the past.

A mix of the conditional 3 + 2 is used when we want to describe a situation from the past which would had an impact on a situation in the present.
