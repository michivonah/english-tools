## Wishes

Sentences with **wish** and **if only** were used when we talk about things we want to change.

We have two types of wish sentences.

*   I wish for something I can change (present)
*   I wish for something someone other can change (present)
*   I wish that something is different that happend in the past. (past)

Take a look at the following table:

| Type of the wish | Form | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Present: I can change it | wish/if only + past tense | I wish I could swim. |
| Present: Someone else can change it | wish + would | I wish they would buy a new oven. |
| Past: I wish that something happend different | wish/if only + past perfect | I wish I had come to work earlier today. |

After a would you always have to use present simple if you write about a thing you want to be changed.
